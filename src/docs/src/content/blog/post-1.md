title: New changelog template + the biggest Tailwind UI update ever
summary: I haven’t shared a Tailwind UI update since we released the Protocol template in December, but that’s not because we haven’t been busy. Over the last four months we’ve probably done more work on Tailwind UI than we ever have, and having finally wrapped up what we set out to achieve I’m excited to lay it all out for you!

Are you looking to learn web development but feeling overwhelmed by the vast array of online resources available? Don't worry, you're not alone. With so many options out there, it can be challenging to know where to start and which resources are worth your time and money. In this post, we'll guide you through the process of finding and choosing the right resources for your web development journey.

## Start with Free Resources

One of the best places to start your web development journey is with free resources. Platforms like FreeCodeCamp and YouTube have a wealth of tutorials and videos that cover the basics of web development. FreeCodeCamp, in particular, is an excellent resource for beginners, providing a structured learning path that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other key web development concepts.

## Move to Paid Courses

Once you've mastered the basics, you may want to consider investing in paid courses. While there are many options out there, Udemy is a great platform to find top-rated courses. Udemy offers a wide range of courses on various web development topics, from front-end development to full-stack development. And if you're not sure where to start, we highly recommend checking out courses by Andrei Neagoie. His courses are well-structured, easy to follow, and always up to date.

Use Your Experience to Judge More Expensive Bootcamps and Courses

If you're looking to take your web development skills to the next level, you may want to consider more expensive bootcamps or courses. However, before investing your time and money, it's important to do your research. Look for reviews from previous students and check out the course syllabus to ensure it aligns with your goals. Additionally, use your experience to judge whether the course is suitable for your current skill level.

## Other Resources

Apart from the above resources, there are other resources that you may find helpful, such as:

CodePen: A platform where you can build, share, and discover web development projects.
W3Schools: A website that provides tutorials and reference materials on web development concepts.
GitHub: A code-sharing and collaboration platform that you can use to store and share your projects with others.
Self-Evaluation and Continuous Learning

Lastly, remember that learning web development is an ongoing process, and it's important to continuously evaluate your progress and adjust your learning strategies accordingly. It's okay to take breaks when you need them and focus on mastering the concepts that you find challenging. Don't forget to practice consistently and build projects outside of your comfort zone to help you level up.

## Self-belief and Aggressive Patience

It's important to believe in yourself and your ability to learn. Imposter syndrome can often creep in and make you doubt your skills, but it's essential to recognize that it's normal to feel this way. Remember to stay patient and don't give up when things get tough. Aggressive patience is the key to success in web development. Keep pushing forward, and you'll soon start to see the results of your hard work.

In conclusion, finding and choosing the right resources for learning web development online can be a daunting task. However, by starting with free resources, investing in paid courses, doing your research, and continuously evaluating your progress, you can build a strong foundation for your web development journey. Remember to believe in yourself, stay patient, and keep practicing. The more you learn and build, the better you'll become.

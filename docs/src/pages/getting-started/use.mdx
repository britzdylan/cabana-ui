# Using Cabana for the first time

Cabana uses a component class based approach to styling. This means that you can use the classes provided by Cabana to style your HTML elements.
We provide pre styled components that you can use out of the box, such as buttons, inputs, avatar, textareas, tooltips, etc.
Some of these components are interactive, such as the buttons, inputs, checkboxes, etc. Some classes and provided html markup in the code previews are both required to make these interactive components work.

## Creating your first component

let's create a button, simply add the `btn` class to the html button element.

<Preview client:load>
  <button class='btn'>Button</button>
  <Code slot='html'>
    ```html
    <button class='btn'>Button</button>
    ```
  </Code>
</Preview>

## Customizing your component

Let's say you want to change the color of the button, you can use the `bg-green-500` class to change the background color of the button.

<Preview client:load>
  <button class='btn bg-green-500'>Button</button>
  <Code slot='html'>
    ```html
    <button class='btn bg-green-500'>button</button>
    ```
  </Code>
</Preview>

As you have noticed the button is now green. However the hover and active states are still the same. To change the hover and active states you can use the `hover:bg-green-600` and `active:bg-green-700` classes. But this causes a lot of manual overrides and can be a bit tedious. To make this easier we provide a `btn-{color}`, where color is any of tailwind's default color names including primary, secondary and tertiary, class that will automatically apply the correct hover and active states.

<Preview client:load>
  <button class='btn btn-green'>Button</button>
  <button class='btn btn-primary'>Button</button>
  <button class='btn btn-fuchsia'>Button</button>
  <Code slot='html'>
    ```html
    <button class='btn btn-green'>Button</button>
    <button class='btn btn-primary'>Button</button>
    <button class='btn btn-fuchsia'>Button</button>
    ```
  </Code>
</Preview>

Cabana includes a few more modifier classes per component similar to above that you can use to change the appearance of your components. Please refer to the [components](/components/buttons) section for more information.

## Styling your own components with Tailwind classes

You can use the classes provided by Tailwind to add specifc styles or overides to components that Cabana does not provide modifier classes for. For example, you can use the `rounded-full` class to style your own button.

<Preview client:load>
  <button class='btn btn-green rounded-full uppercase text-sm px-3 py-2 focus:outline-none'>
    Sign In
  </button>
  <Code slot='html'>
    ```html
    <button class='btn btn-green rounded-full uppercase text-sm px-3 py-2 focus:outline-none'>
      Sign In
    </button>
    ```
  </Code>
</Preview>

## Styling your own components with Tailwind's @apply directive

You can also use the `@apply` directive to apply custom CSS to your components. For example, you can use the `@apply` directive to style your own button.

<Preview client:load>
  <button class='btn btn-red rounded-full uppercase text-sm px-3 py-2 focus:outline-none'>
    Sign In
  </button>
  <Code slot="html">
  ```css
  .btn {
    @apply btn-red rounded-full uppercase text-sm px-3 py-2 focus:outline-none;
  }
  ```
</Code>
</Preview>

<Alert>
  Some components CSS specificity is higher than others. Using Tailwind's
  classes sometimes won't work as expected. In these cases you can use the
  `!important` keyword to override Cabana's styles.
